Practice Structure:
30 min - Notes/review
1 hr - scrim 1
1 hr - scrim 2

Practice expectations:
- We all have things to do, so practice time should be used as efficiently as possible. Please come to practice on-time and warmed up.
- In general, practice will not be used for learning nades. You will be expected to learn the utility for the spots you play on your own time.
- Strats and defaults will be provided on the stratbook, and you are expected to know your default position and your role in the strats. We will go over this in practice, but it should be more of a quick review than me teaching you.
- Finally, this is a team effort. I'm providing the structure to get us moving in the right direction, but I expect and welcome everyone to come in with their own input and experience. I'll provide time for everyone to have input on strats, defaults, spots, protocols, and anything else at the beginning of each practice. I don't expect anyone to start playing 8 hours a day, but I do expect everyones best effort into this team. If you can't commit to that, we'll find someone else who will.
